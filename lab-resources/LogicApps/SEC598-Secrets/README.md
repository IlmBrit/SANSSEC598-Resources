This GitHub repository hosts a Logic App template tailored for the SANS SEC598 course, specifically for Lab 3.2, focusing on creating automated actions within Azure. The template includes a custom incident trigger within Sentinel and is designed to automate several tasks, including sending email notifications in response to specific triggers. The primary objective is to enhance security monitoring by detecting suspicious activities in Entra ID's audit logs and streamlining responses to changes in app registrations. For more detailed steps and configurations, please refer to the official course material.
